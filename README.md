# SmartResumeHub

**SmartResumeHub** is an innovative project designed to transform unstructured resume data into structured, actionable information using advanced AI techniques and Pydantic models. This tool leverages the power of machine learning and natural language processing to parse and organize resume content, making it easier for developers, HR professionals, and data analysts to automate and streamline the recruitment process.

## Features

- **Resume Parsing**: Convert resumes from various formats (PDF, DOCX) into structured JSON.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Utilize GPT models to extract detailed components such as work experience, education, certifications, and personal details.
- **Data Normalization**: Ensures all data conforms to a standardized format for ease of use in other systems.
- **Customizable Templates**: Users can define and customize the output formats to meet specific requirements.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple resumes efficiently, making it suitable for both small projects and large-scale HR operations.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The core language used for development.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and schema definitions.
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the AI components for extracting detailed resume data.
- **Streamlit**: For creating a web-based interface that allows users to upload and process resumes interactively.

## Usage

Instructions on how to set up and use **SmartResumeHub** will be provided, including how to install dependencies, configure the system, and execute the tool to process resumes.

## Improvements

- **Enhanced Data Contextualization**: Integrate an additional API call to fetch metadata about the resume content. This metadata can provide context and clarification, thereby increasing the accuracy and relevancy of the extracted information from resumes.

- **Performance Optimization**: Explore the integration of C++ modules for critical performance bottlenecks, particularly in the data formatting stages. This could significantly speed up the processing time, making the application more efficient for handling large volumes of resumes.

- **Zip Uploads and Directory Structuring**: Implement functionality that allows users to upload multiple resumes in a Zip file. Additionally, introduce a directory structure within the application to systematically separate and organize resumes based on profession, such as doctors and nurses, enhancing manageability and accessibility.

- **API Call Optimization**: Reduce the number of API calls by grouping related data extraction tasks. Merge personal details and educational details into one call, work experiences into another, and licenses with certifications into a third. This consolidation could reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of data processing by minimizing the token usage in interactions with the OpenAI API.
